## Abstract

<h5>Introduction</h5>
In our world, there is unfairness in the concept of development. Many people work on themselves to improve, while others depend on luck. Sometimes, luck is the winning team leaving all people working hard broken and back to the start. Developing an idea to help those people in upgrading their workplace is our goal. The idea is to create an application to allow local stores to put their home-made products online to let people find them and order to their home. The following paper presents the idea of "Dekanji" which is an application that allows the user to sign up as a buyer or store owner, sign in, and display his products. This application will be a great benefit for local store owners to display their products for people to allow them to purchase them. As we know, Lebanon is living a crisis affecting all stores and closure of small business. This application shall help the owners of the small businesses by providing them with a free application to help them in surviving this pandemic.

<h5>Overview</h5>
With the development of multinational supermarkets, local stores are losing their customers resulting in their closure. With the spread of Covid-19, multinational supermarkets also could allow customers to shop online. The most affecting factor is the economic crisis we are facing which is leading the local business to closure faster than ever. Customers are appealing to online shopping neglecting the local stores and making them lose. In these days, online shopping is the key to grab the people.

Nowadays, mobile applications are the key to success. Wherever and whenever you go, your smartphone is always with you. Add to this, mobile applications allow the user to have easy, functional access to information, products, services, and processes that they need in real-time and are optimized for hands on interaction (Hilliard, 2014). Users may order products whenever they want because of having their phone with them. Which will help the local stores in increasing their sales. As we are evolving into a mobile-centric society, it comes as no surprise that mobile apps are at the center of the developmental push. Mobile apps shall help in expanding the audience and increasing engagement (staff reporter, 2020). Mobile applications help improve customer engagement through chats and order forms. Ordering a product in just a few clicks is significantly faster and less stressful for many than making a phone call for the same purpose. Add to this, mobile apps enable companies to receive feedbacks from the customers side to be able to improve their performance and customer experience. With expectations set by mobile applications such as Amazon and Ali Express, delivery and order tracking are a standard requirement (Hanaoka, 2020).

Based on what is mentioned above, developing a free-based mobile application for local grocery stores is an important step in helping people during this crisis we are passing through. With all the negative factors mentioned that are leading to the closure of small businesses, developing a mobile app to allow them to add their signature product is a big step in decreasing the closure rate of small business.
